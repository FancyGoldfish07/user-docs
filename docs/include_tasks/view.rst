   The list of all tasks


Tasks with due dates have a clock indicator to the right of the task name.
Signavio Workflow Accelerator shows this indicator in red when a taskâ€™s due date has arrived.

You can use the controls on the right to filter the tasks list,
which you will find useful when the workload increases.
