Completing tasks
-----------------

Use the highlighted `Done` button (the square on the green background) to complete a task.

When tasks have a form, the task page displays the form in the same position and includes the button(s) to complete the task at the bottom of the form.
The task page normally only includes a `Done` button, but will display multiple buttons when you use a decision.
Each of those buttons will register the decision and complete the task in one go.
