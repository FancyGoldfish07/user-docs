Reopening tasks
---------------

When the task page shows a `Reopen` button, it means that someone completed the task but you can reopen it.
You cannot reopen a task that has a form, because completing the task finalises the form data.
You may want to reopen a task that you closed a task by accident,
or when you learn about additional work that belongs to this task.
If you just forgot to attach a document or make a comment, you can still do that without reopening the task.

Reopening a task instead of creating a new task has the advantage that
the existing task retains its context.
