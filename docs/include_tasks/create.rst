Creating case tasks
-------------------

To create tasks, open a case, and use the tasks list to add a new task.
Enter the task title in the text box to create the task.

.. figure:: /_static/images/tasks/create/create-task.png

   Type the title of the new task and type Enter

After you have added a task, it appears in the list:

.. figure:: /_static/images/tasks/create/view-task.png

When a process starts, Signavio Workflow Accelerator creates a :ref:`case <cases>` and starts all elements that do not have incoming transitions.
