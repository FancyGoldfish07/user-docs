Task filters
------------

The *All tasks* view includes several kinds of task filters,
that you can use to manage a long list of tasks.

- *Involvement filter* - shows tasks according to how they relate to you,
  such as tasks you started.
- *Process* filter - shows tasks for a specific process.
- *Due date* filter - shows tasks according to their due dates,
  such as only overdue tasks.
- *Completed* filter - shows complete tasks, which the task list normally excludes.
- *Assignee filter* - shows tasks that have a specific assignee, or tasks that have a specific candidate.
