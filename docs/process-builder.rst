Process builder
===============

A process defines a template for automating repetitive work, like a recipe that describes the actions that you perform to achieve a goal.
For example, consider a :ref:`Hire employee <hire-employee>` process.
Each time an organization hires someone, the recruitment team has to complete a number of tasks, including ‘Evaluate CV’, ‘Plan interview’ and ‘Interview candidate’.
Each time someone starts the process, Signavio Workflow creates a new case.

Use the process builder to create and configure executable processes.
You can think of an executable process as a kind of software,
but you will find it easier to build automation using processes.
With Signavio Workflow, non-technical people can create useful processes.
