Process locking
---------------

In the process builder, only one person can edit a process at a time.
When someone else is editing a process,
there is a message in the `Processes` list.

   The `Processes` list message when someone else `is currently working on this process`

You can still open the process,
but you will see a warning message explaining that you will not be able to make changes:

   Warning that you will not be able to make edit a process at the same time as someone else

You will be able to edit the process and make changes after the other person leaves the process editor,
by opening the `Tasks` list, for example.
