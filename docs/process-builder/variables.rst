Variables
---------

A process has variables that store workflow data when the process runs.
All the information in forms and information required by the actions will be connected to these variables.
Each case stores its own values for each workflow variable.

A workflow variable can contain a single value, such as a reference number,
or containing multiple fields, such as an email,
which has fields like `from`, `to`, `subject` and `attachments`.
