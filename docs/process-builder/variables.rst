Variables
---------

A process has variables that store workflow data when the process runs.
These variables contain all of the information from forms as well as information required by the process actions.
Each case stores its own values for each workflow variable.

A workflow variable can contain a single value, such as a reference number,
or containing multiple fields, such as an email,
which has fields like `from`, `to`, `subject` and `attachments`.
