.. _start-process:

Starting a new process case
---------------------------

A *process case* uses the latest version of the workflow defined by a published process.
It creates a collaboration space for working towards a predefined goal.

You can create a new process case by selecting the *Start new case* button in one of three places:

#. in the process builder, on the :ref:`versions` page, next to the latest published version
#. on the *Processes* page, next to the name of each published process
#. on the :ref:`cases overview <cases-overview>` page, for the selected process.

If the process does not define a trigger, then you enter a case name as when :ref:`start-adhoc`.
Other trigger types generate their own case names, or use a :ref:`case name template <details>`.
