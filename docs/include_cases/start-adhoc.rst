Starting an ad-hoc case
-----------------------

Signavio Workflow supports two types of cases: cases that relate to a process and ad-hoc cases.
An *ad-hoc case* does not have a predefined process.
It creates a collaboration space that you can use to reach a one-off goal.

To create a new ad-hoc case, navigate to *Cases*;
on the *Cases of* menu, select *Cases without a process*, then click *Start new case*.
