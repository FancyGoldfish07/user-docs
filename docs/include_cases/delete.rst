Deleting a case
---------------

You do not normally delete cases in Workflow Accelerator: you close cases that you have finished working on.
However, you sometimes do need to delete cases, such as the test cases that you create while developing the initial versions of a process model.

To delete a case, open the case and use its right-hand actions menu to select `Delete case`.
