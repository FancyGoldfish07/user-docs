Exporting cases data
--------------------

You can export the information about a processâ€™ cases to a `CSV file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_ that you can open in a spreadsheet.
To export case data, open the :ref:`Cases overview <cases-overview>`, select a process, and then select *Export as CSV*.
You may find this useful for reporting or auditing, for example.

   CSV export options

Use the CSV export options to specify the ordering of exported cases, whether to filter by status (open or closed), and the output format.
Try a different output format option if you have problems loading the exported CSV file into another application, such as Microsoft Excel.
The output format options determine which characters the CSV output uses to quote and separate characters and lines:

* *Standard* - conventional CSV format
* *Excel* - Microsoft Excel compatibility mode
* *Excel (Northern Europe)* - better Excel compatibility for some European countries
* *Tabs* - separate values with tabs instead of commas.

The CSV export uses *UTF-8 text encoding*.
Select *UTF-8* when opening the CSV in Microsoft Excel, for example, to preserve characters such as letters with accents.
