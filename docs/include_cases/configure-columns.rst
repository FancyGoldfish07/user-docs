Configuring case view table columns
-----------------------------------

The *Cases* view’s table includes columns for workflow :ref:`variables <variables>`,
which usually correspond to form fields on a trigger form or in a user task.
You can select which fields the Cases view shows as table columns,
so you can have a clear overview of the process’ cases.

To customize the table columns,
open the Cases view and click the top-right *Configure columns* button.

   Configuring table columns

Use the drag icon on the far left of the list of columns to change the column order,
and click the delete icon on the far right to remove a column.
You can also use the text box to edit the column’s heading.

Below the list of columns, you’ll find a menu for selecting additional column to add to the table.

   Adding a column to the table

The menu lists all of the workflow variables that the table does not currently include.
In this example, the *Interviewer* variable has the type *User*, which means that you can access additional fields for the user’s email address, first name, ID and last name.
