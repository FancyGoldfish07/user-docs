Commenting on a case
--------------------

Working on a case often includes collaboration with other people.
You can use the case view to discuss the case with other people,
which results in a discussion in the event stream.

   Comments on a case - discussion with context

By using case comments instead of email, participants ensure that discussions retain the full context for everyone involved.

In the event stream, reply to existing comments to keep the discussion structured.
Hover over the user avatar to see the user’s full name:

Hover over the relative time to see the comment’s full time stamp:

To add a comment, type in the text box above the event stream.
Everyone who has access to the case can follow the discussion.
Keeping the discussion ‘inside’ the case preserves the context,
which makes it easier to follow than an email conversation.

Sometimes, you want to direct a comment to a specific person.
While entering a comment,
you can ‘mention’ someone by typing a ``@`` and choosing their name from the list.
When you mention someone in a comment,
Workflow Accelerator sends them an email notification to bring them into the discussion.

   Mentioning someone in a comment

You can also mention two specific groups, corresponding to people working on the case.
Enter ``@all`` to mention all participants in the case.
Enter ``@open`` to mention the assignees of open tasks within the case.

You can also use `Markdown`_ formatting in comments,
for things like text styles, headings and lists.

   Using Markdown formatting in a case comment

You may find Markdown most useful for adding links to external information that relates to the case.
