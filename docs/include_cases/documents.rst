Attaching documents to a case
-----------------------------

As well as commenting on a case, to share information with the case’s participants, you can attach documents.
For example, cases in a job vacancy process might require candidate CVs.
Anyone can access the case can download a case’s documents, which makes them more useful than email attachments.

To attach a document to a case, select the the `Upload a document` option next to where you add comments.

The case’s event stream shows the document, with its file name and size.
Click the icon on the right to open the document.

If cases regularly require the same document as part of the process, you can make this clearer to people who work on cases by adding a file upload form field to a :ref:`user task form <user-task-form>`.
