Example processes
=================

This chapter describes a number of example processes.
Effektif includes some of these examples within the application, so you don’t have to start from scratch when you develop your first process model.
These examples may also give you some inspiration for how to use Effektif’s features in your own models.

In the main menu, select `Examples` to browse the list, and expand each example to read a description.
Select `Copy to your organisation` to open a copy of an example in the :ref:`process-builder`, so you can explore the process model, modify it and publish it.
If you don’t want to use an example you have copied, you can :ref:`delete it <copy-process>`.
