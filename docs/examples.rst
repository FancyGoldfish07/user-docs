Example processes
=================

This chapter describes a number of example processes.
Signavio Workflow includes some of these include_examples within the application, so you don’t have to start from scratch when you develop your first process model.
These include_examples may also give you some inspiration for how to use Signavio Workflow’s features in your own models.

In the main menu, select `include_examples` to browse the list, and expand each example to read a description.
Select `Copy to your organisation` to open a copy of an example in the :ref:`process-builder`, so you can explore the process model, modify it and publish it.
If you don’t want to use an example you have copied, you can :ref:`delete it <copy-process>`.
