When you leave an organisation, Workflow Accelerator will:

* remove you from the organisation’s groups
* remove you from process models (process owner, access controls, action candidates)
* unassign you from tasks in the organisation’s processes
* remove your participation in cases of the organisation’s processes
* free up one of the organisation’s Workflow Accelerator licenses.

The `Services` section shows your personal configurations for third-party services,
such as a linked Google Account.
