In most cases, the top row of user tasks will process the claim.
Only a few claims will require the *Investigate high-value claim* or *Process complex claim* tasks.

* *Junior claims adjuster* - triages insurance claims and processes the straightforward ones.
* *Investigator* - investigates high-value claims to protect against fraudulent claims.
* *Senior claims adjuster* - processes complex claims.

Fields

* *Claim form* (File, mandatory) - the form provided by the customer, via the trigger form.
* *Total value* (Money, mandatory) - the total value of the claim, which the junior adjuster extracts from the claim form in the *Calculate claim value* task.
