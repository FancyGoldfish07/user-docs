.. _end-event:

End event
---------

.. figure:: /_static/images/control-flow/end-event.png

   An end event in the process editor

Like start events, you can also omit end events.
End events mark the end of an execution flow:

.. figure:: /_static/images/control-flow/end-event-1.png

   End event

Equivalently:

.. figure:: /_static/images/control-flow/end-event-2.png

   No end event
