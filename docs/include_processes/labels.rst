.. _process-labels:

Labels
------

When several departments in your organization create processes, the :ref:`processes list <processes-list>` becomes full of other people’s processes.
Labels categorize processes so you can filter the list by label.

After creating a process, select *Click to add labels* to choose one or more labels from a list.
The list starts with a set of default labels that administrators can :ref:`configure <labels>`.
Select a label’s delete icon to remove it from a process.
