Process locking
---------------

In the process builder, only one person can edit a process at a time.
While someone continues to edit a process, the `Processes` list shows a message.

   The `Processes` list message while someone else edits the process

You can still open the process,
but you will see a warning message explaining that you cannot make changes:

   Warning that you cannot edit a process at the same time as someone else

You can edit the process and make changes after the other person leaves the process editor,
by opening the `Tasks` list, for example.
