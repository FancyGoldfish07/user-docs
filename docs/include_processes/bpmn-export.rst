BPMN export
-----------

You can export a Workflow Accelerator process model as a BPMN 2.0 XML file.
You may find this useful for opening the model in another tool that supports BPMN,
or to make a backup that you can load using the :ref:`BPMN import <bpmn-import>` option.

To export a process model, first open it in the Workflow Accelerator process editor.
Select the menu next to the `Publish changes` button,
then select `Export BPMN 2.0 XML`.

   Using the `Export BPMN 2.0 XML` option to save a process model in a file

This results in a file download that describes your process model in BPMN format.
Workflow Accelerator only exports one kind of BPMN file, so it doesnâ€™t give you any options to configure.
