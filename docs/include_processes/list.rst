Browsing processes
------------------

Select *Processes* in the main menu to browse your organization’s processes.
Each process has an icon that indicates what kind of :ref:`trigger <triggers>` it has, the process owner’s avatar and the process name.
You can also add labels to categorize processes.
If you have published a process, you can use the button to :ref:`start a new case <start-process>`.
