Choosing a good process name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following guidelines to choose a good process name, to make the list of processes easier to read and talk about.

#. Describe the process goal.
#. Use an imperative verb phrase that completes a sentence like *For your next job, you have to…*
#. Use more than one word, to get a descriptive name.
#. Avoid using more than three or four words.
#. Avoid vague words like ‘manage’, ‘do’, ‘process’ or ‘handle’.

*Hire employee*, for example, summarises a process better than *Recruitment*.


Next steps for a new process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have created a process, continue to build the process model using the following process builder sections.

* :ref:`triggers` determine how you start new cases for the process
* :ref:`actions` define the flow for tasks and other steps in the process
* :ref:`details` include process metadata and access control.
