Initiate Project (project delivery)
-----------------------------------

Process goal
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete checklists that capture basic information when starting a new project.

Context
^^^^^^^	

When a project organisation starts a new project, the project team (or project manager) needs to capture a project overview that introduces the project and how it will work to other stakeholders.
However, no-one ever seems to have time to write detailed documentation at the start of the project.
You can use a checklist to capture a set of tasks that might otherwise get forgotten, without any particular structure or sequence to the process.
A checklist’s main value comes from identifying tasks that you might otherwise forget.
A project initiation checklist addresses questions about the project’s overview and the project plan.
An Workflow Accelerator process can present simple forms that guide this initial data collection.

Trigger
^^^^^^^

Manual.

Actions
^^^^^^^

This process represents a checklist with one user task for each piece of required project documentation.
Each user task adds a level of detail by splitting these project initiation summaries into sections.

The project manager can complete these tasks in any order.

Roles
^^^^^

*Project manager* - responsible for capturing the project summaries.
In practice, the project manager may delegate these tasks to other team members, by assigning the user tasks.

Fields
^^^^^^

The *Project overview* task includes the following fields.

* *Business context* (Text)
* *Vision* (Text)
* *Goals* (Text, multiple values)
* *Deliverables* (Text, multiple values)

Similarly, the *Project plan* task captures a summary for each of:

* *Resources* (Text, multiple values)
* *Approach* (Text)
* *Start date* (Date)
* *Success factors* (Text, multiple values)
* *Risks* (Text, multiple values)

You could simplify these forms by using *Yes/No* choices instead of text fields, turning each task into a checklist of its own.
However, asking questions like *Do you have a project vision?* does not focus the mind as well as trying to write a well-formed sentence, which makes you think about about it the question more and forces you to prove that you have an answer.

Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

In general, you will extend this process with additional checklist tasks for project initiation work.
You can extend this process to include a project approval task, based on the information given.
