Onboard new hire (HR)
---------------------

Process goal
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Learn about the new hire, create a working environment where the new hire can start working and allow the new hire to learn about the company.

Context
^^^^^^^

When companies don’t pay attention to onboarding, they experience problems like an employee arriving on their first day to discover that no-one can welcome them, or that they don’t have a desk.
This kind of problem wastes time and creates a bad first impression.
A company’s human resources staff typically improves the employee onboarding experience by implementing a consistent process.

Trigger
^^^^^^^

Form - the new hire’s name and address.

Actions
^^^^^^^

The process consists of four phases, which occur at different times.

The process starts when the new hire signs an employment contract, at which point the company can send a welcome pack.
Next, various parts of the company must complete preparation tasks before the new hire’s first day in office.
The first day itself forms the next phase, followed by a longer follow-up and evaluation phase, possibly in the form of a formal trial period.

Roles
^^^^^

* *HR assistant* - introduces the new hire to the company.
* *Line manager* - introduces the new hire to their daily work.
