Processes
=========

A process defines a template for automating repetitive work, like a recipe that describes the actions that you perform to achieve a goal.
For example, consider a :ref:`Hire employee <hire-employee>` process.
Each time an organization hires someone, the recruitment team has to complete a number of tasks, including ‘Evaluate CV’, ‘Plan interview’ and ‘Interview candidate’.
Each time someone starts the process, Workflow Accelerator creates a new case.

Use the process builder to create and configure executable processes.
You can think of an executable process as a kind of software,
but you will find it easier to build automation using processes.
With Workflow Accelerator, non-technical people can create useful processes.
