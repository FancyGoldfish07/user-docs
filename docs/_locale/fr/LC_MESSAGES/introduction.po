"`Signavio Workflow <http://www.signavio.com/products/workflow/>`_ is a "
"web-based workflow modelling and execution platform. Although its "
"heritage includes classical Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), "
"Signavio Workflow dramatically simplifies workflow automation."

msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process - strictly a process *model* - defines a template for "
"repetitive work. The people who manage work typically create processes "
"and specify the tasks and actions that you must complete to reach a "
"certain goal. For example: for every :ref:`Hire employee <hire-employee>`"
" case, someone must complete the *Plan interview*, *Interview candidate* "
"and *Send job offer* tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you publish a process, you can start many individual cases. "
"Signavio Workflow keeps track of which tasks and actions you have to "
"perform for each case. Cases bring people together with relevant "
"information that provides context for completing the tasks. You can also "
"use cases as collaboration spaces for people to discuss and create new "
"tasks for individual cases on the fly."
