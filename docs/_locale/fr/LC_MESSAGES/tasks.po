"position and includes the button(s) to complete the task at the bottom of"
" the form. The task page normally only includes a `Done` button, but will"
" display multiple buttons when you use a decision. Each of those buttons "
"will register the decision and complete the task in one go."

msgid "Reopening tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the task page shows a `Reopen` button, it means that someone "
"completed the task but you can reopen it. You cannot reopen a task that "
"has a form, because completing the task finalises the form data. You may "
"want to reopen a task that you closed a task by accident, or when you "
"learn about additional work that belongs to this task. If you just forgot"
" to attach a document or make a comment, you can still do that without "
"reopening the task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reopening a task instead of creating a new task has the advantage that "
"the existing task retains its context."
