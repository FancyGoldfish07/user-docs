"Each case has an event stream that acts as an audit log and includes the "
"information that is shared during collaboration, such as comments, documents"
" and links. By using case comments instead of email, participants ensure "

"An *ad-hoc case* is a case without a predefined process. It’s a "
"collaboration space to reach any one-off goal. The case brings together a "
"set of tasks, a discussion and documents, and allows participants to share "
"any relevant context information for the tasks."

"For example, consider a `Hire employee` process. Each time someone is hired,"

"Actions are the steps in a process that represent things to be done. When "

"A trigger in a process specifies when the process is started. The manual "

" case inside Effektif. The form trigger allows to specify a form that you "
"have to complete to start a new process case. The email trigger creates a "
"new process case when it receives email at its own email address. There is "
"no direct relation between triggers and start events."

"Process roles are different from organizational roles. For example, there "

"An organization represents a collection of Effektif users - typically a "
