msgid "Reopening a task"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you see the `Reopen` button in a task, it means the task is completed. "

msgid "An exclusive gateway in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use an exclusive gateway to make a choice between multiple execution paths. "

msgstr ""

msgid "Human decision"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a human decision for an exclusive gateway when a person must make a "

"contract’:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An exclusive gateway must have at least one incoming and two outgoing "
"transitions"

"will be configured:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Default human decision configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`To Print contract` and `To Update contract` are the default decision "

"When adding form fields to the task before the exclusive gateway - `Review "
"contract` in this example - the decision buttons are added to the form."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic decision"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An automatic decision is an exclusive gateway that selects an outgoing "
"transition based on conditions that you choose. For each transition, you can"
" formulate a condition using workflow data. Transition conditions are "
"evaluated in order, from top to bottom. The workflow engine will take the "
"transition with the first condition that is true, using the current case’s "
"field values."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic decision condition editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To specify a condition, start by selecting a field and a comparison "
"operator. Enter either a static value in the input field on the right, or "
"click the |binding-symbol| button to select another field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A condition can include multiple field value comparisons. To add more sub-"
"conditions, click the button at the bottom of the list. You can also use the"
" select field at the top to specify that either **all** conditions in the "
"list must be true, or that it is enough for at least one of them to be true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a sub-condition is incompletely specified, evaluating the whole "
"condition will fail and the transition will not be taken. The |warning-"
"symbol| symbol indicates an incomplete sub-condition, while the |check-"
"symbol| symbol indicates that the sub-condition is valid. Click either of "
"these symbols to remove the sub condition from the list."
msgstr ""

msgid "An unspecified condition is marked with a |warning-symbol| symbol."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An automatic decision usually has a default transition. A default transition"
" is a fallback mechanism: if none of the conditions evaluate to true, the "
"default transition is taken."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make a transition the default, select the ‘per default’ item in the "
"selection field at the top."

msgid "Parallel Gateway"
msgstr ""

msgid "A parallel gateway in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use parallel gateways to model tasks that will be completed at the same time"
" as each other, or one at a time but not in a particular order. To do this, "
"you *fork* and *join* the sequence flow."
msgstr ""

msgid "Forking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With a parallel gateway, you can fork execution into multiple, concurrent "
"flows. When process execution arrives in a parallel gateway, a new "
"individual execution flow is created for each of the gateway’s outgoing "
"transitions. Let’s look at the following purchase order example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A parallel gateway example"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, the parallel gateway will be activated when the `Enter "
"purchase order` user task is completed. The parallel gateway will create two"
" individual paths of execution. One will take the transition to `Receive "
"payment` and create that user task. Meanwhile, the other will create the "
"`Send goods` user task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After `Enter purchase order` completes, both tasks `Receive payment` and "
"`Send goods` will be created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can have as many outgoing transitions as you want. All destination tasks"
" for those transitions will be started at once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Joining"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You also use a parallel gateway to join concurrent paths back together. In "
"this case, the joining parallel gateway has more then one incoming "
"transition. Workflow execution will wait at the gateway until as many "
"execution flows arrive as it has incoming transitions. When the last "
"concurrent flow arrives, the joining parallel gateway will activate and one "
"execution flow will be created on the outgoing transition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To continue the previous example, extend the purchase order process to look:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A parallel gateway example with join"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, `Archive purchase order` will only start after both "
"`Receive payment` and `Send goods` are complete."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default forking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, multiple outgoing transitions out of an action like a user task "
"will be interpreted as parallel. Meaning that if you have multiple "
"transitions out of a user task, all destination actions of those transitions"
" will be performed concurrently. Let’s look at a simple example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After `Send goods` completes, both tasks `Receive payment` and `Send goods` "
"will be created immediate."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can combine default forking with a parallel gateway for joining."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default merging"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When multiple transitions lead to a user task, the user task will be started"
" for each execution flow that arrives there. This means that there is no "
"implicit joining for parallel flows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parallel gateway issues"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will end up with problems if you loop back over parallel gateways. To "
"avoid situations:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Undesirable loopback"
msgstr ""

msgid "and this:"

"that scope."
msgstr ""

msgid "Start event"
msgstr ""

msgid "A start event in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A start event marks the start of a process. All process elements that do not"
" have incoming transitions are considered start elements. Start events don’t"
" have a direct connection to triggers. You can usually leave out start "
"events if you want to create more consice diagrams."
msgstr ""

msgid "End event"
msgstr ""

msgid "An end event in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Effektif is a web-based workflow modelling and execution platform. Although "
"its heritage includes classical Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), "
"Effektif dramatically simplifies workflow automation."
msgstr ""

msgid "When to use Effektif"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Effektif is ideal for describing and collaborating on routine work. Use "
"Effektif for:"
msgstr ""

msgid "coordinating tasks and handovers"
msgstr ""

msgid "approvals"
msgstr ""

msgid "routing documents"
msgstr ""

msgid "fully-fledged business processes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Benefits"
msgstr ""

msgid "You’ll get:"
msgstr ""

msgid "control where it’s needed"
msgstr ""

msgid "flexibility where it’s possible"
msgstr ""

msgid "fewer delays (with automatic triggers, actions and timers)"
msgstr ""

msgid "no more miscommunications during handovers"
msgstr ""

msgid "traceability - data on who did what"
msgstr ""

msgid "clarity - visibility of who has to do what"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"agility - because Effektif process models are easier to change than "
"software."
msgstr ""

msgid "Process builder"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process builder is used to create and configure executable processes. An"
" executable process is similar to software, but it’s easier to build "
"automations using processes. With Effektif, non-technical people can create "
"useful processes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A trigger defines when a process is started. There is no relation between "
"triggers and BPMN start events. See :ref:`Start event <start-event>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A manual trigger is the simplest way to start a process. With a manual "
"trigger, you start processes manually in Effektif, by selecting `Start new "
"case` and then selecting the process to start."
msgstr ""

msgid "Form trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With a form trigger, you use a form to start a process. After selecting the "
"form trigger, you can use the form builder to specify form fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Form trigger configuration - using the form builder to define a trigger form"
msgstr ""

msgid "Email trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An email trigger starts a new case for each email that you send to the "
"trigger‘s Effektif email address. Note this is different from reading an "
"existing email account, such as your own. After selecting the email trigger,"
" you can see its email address:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Mail trigger configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The email trigger creates an email variable that stores the email that "
"started the process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way to use an email trigger is to add the trigger email address to a "
"mailing list, such as `support@example.com `or `info@example.com`. You’ll "
"have to ask the administrator of the mailing list to add the process "
"trigger’s email address to the list. Once you have done this, email sent to "
"the mailing list will also be forwarded to the process trigger address, "
"starting the process in Effektif. You will then see the email in the "
"activity stream:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Trigger mail in stream"
msgstr ""

msgid "Salesforce trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Salesforce trigger starts a new case in response to Salesforce sending an "
"outbound message as part of a Salesforce workflow. Before you can use a "
"Salesforce trigger, configure :ref:`Salesforce Integration <salesforce-"
"integration>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you have configured a Salesforce service, you can select it as a "
"process trigger, so that messages from Salesforce will now trigger new "
"cases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example of a Salesforce trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the process definition, you can use the Salesforce object fields that are"
" included in the Salesforce message just like normal :ref:`variables "
"<variables>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Actions are like steps in a process. An action might be a user task in "
"Effektif, an operation on a file in a document management system or any "
"other action that represents something to be done in a process."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *Process builder*’s actions palette"
msgstr ""

msgid "Simple action list view"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The simple action list view is the simplest way to create a process, as a "
"list of actions. It’s the easiest way to create ‘checklist processes’, which"
" have a collection of user tasks that serve as a checklist."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don’t add any control flow in the `Advanced flows` view, all actions "
"will be started immediately when the process starts. By default, all actions"
" in the simple action list view run in parallel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced flows view"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Advanced flows` view is a `BPMN "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation>`_ diagram"
" editor that shows actions and control flow elements like events and "
"gateways. You use the `Advanced flows` view to add sequential flows between "
"actions, decisions and other control flow behaviour."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create a transition in the `Advanced flows` view. A transition "
"specifies sequential flow, which means the next action only starts when the "
"previous one is complete."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a transition, click to select the first action. Several symbols "
"appear to the right of the selected element:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Start creating a transition by dragging the transition symbol to the "
"destination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the transition symbol |transition-symbol| and drag it to the "
"destination element. When you drag the symbol over the destination element, "
"it indicates that you can drop to create the transition:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a transition hovering over destination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release the mouse button over the destination to create the transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating the next user task"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is an easy way to create the next User Task in a process, similar to "
"creating transitions above. Start by selecting the previous action:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Start creating the next user task by dragging the action symbol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the rounded rectangle symbol |task-symbol| and drag it to an empty "
"place on the canvas."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drag the rounded rectangle symbol to an empty place"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Drop the symbol where you want to create the next user task. Release the "
"mouse button to create new user task where you dropped it, with a transition"
" from the previous action."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding the next user task and its transition at the same time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, just click the user task icon |task-symbol| to create a new "
"user task in the default location, with a transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control flow elements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Control flow elements like events and gateways are also part of the diagram,"
" but unlike actions, control flow elements don’t represent something that "
"should happen. Instead, you use events and gateways to specify the flow "
"between the actions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process has variables that store workflow data when the process runs. All "
"the information in forms and information required by the actions will be "
"connected to these variables. Each case stores its own values for each "
"process variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A trigger form that populates a *Reference number* variable for use in a "
"workflow"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process variable can contain a single value, such as a reference number, "
"or containing multiple fields, such as an email, which has fields like "
"`from`, `to`, `subject` and `attachments`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Roles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A role (a.k.a. process role) is a kind of process variable that is used for "
"assigning tasks. A role is a variable of type user that stores a single user"
" You can optionally configure a role with a list of canidates. Roles are "
"equivalent to swimlanes in BPMN."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These process roles are not the same as organization roles. For example, you"
" can be a team lead in your organization, which can be a position without an"
" end date. A process role, such as ‘Reviewer’, has a different scope and "
"only applies for the duration of a single case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assigning a task to a *Support engineer* role with candidates Alice and Ben"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use a role to assign multiple tasks a person from a group of "
"candidates. For example, you might have a support process that includes "
"three user tasks that are assigned to a support engineer. Instead, assign "
"the three tasks to a new role called ‘Support engineer’, and add the "
"relevant people as candidates for the role."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating the first task that has a role will notify all of the candidates "
"for the role. When one of the candidates takes the task, the subsequent "
"tasks with the same role will be assigned to the same person. That’s "
"efficient because this person has the context knowledge about that case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you reassign a task that has a role assignment, Effektif will update the "
"role variable, and assign all subsequent tasks with the same role to the new"
" assignee."
msgstr ""

msgid "Terminology"
msgstr ""

msgid "Case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *case* is a collaboration page for a particular goal. A case has subtasks "
"representing the concrete action items to reach the goal. There are two "
"types of cases: process cases and ad-hoc cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each case has an event stream that acts as an audit log and includes the "
"information that is shared during collaboration, such as comments, documents"
" and links. By using case comments instead of email, participants ensure "
"that discussions retain the full context for everyone involved. See "
":ref:`Cases <cases>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Process case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *process case* is a case that is associated with a defined process. The "
"process describes what actions have to be done and in which order. In BPM "
"terminology, a process case is also known as a *process instance*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ad-hoc case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An *ad-hoc case* is a case without a predefined process. It’s a "
"collaboration space to reach any one-off goal. The case brings together a "
"set of tasks, a discussion and documents, and allows participants to share "
"any relevant context information for the tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Task"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tasks are concrete action items inside a case that can be assigned to "
"people. In process cases, a task may have been created by a user task "
"action."
msgstr ""

msgid "Process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process is a template to automate repetitive work, like a recipe that "
"describes the actions that have to be performed to achieve a goal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, consider a `Hire employee` process. Each time someone is hired,"
" three tasks have to be completed: ‘Conduct interview’, ‘Prepare contract’ "
"and ‘Create email account’. Each time the process is started, a new case is "
"created."
msgstr ""

msgid "Action"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Actions are the steps in a process that represent things to be done. When "
"starting a process, Effektif will ‘execute’ the actions in a process in the "
"proper order. This ordering is also refered to as :ref:`control flow "
"<control-flow>` and is specified with transitions, gateways and events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are different types of actions: a user task will create a task in a "
"case. A ‘Send Email’ action will send an email. A ‘Google file upload’ "
"action will upload a file to a Google Drive folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "Trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A trigger in a process specifies when the process is started. The manual "
"trigger is the simplest, and starts the process when you start a new process"
" case inside Effektif. The form trigger allows to specify a form that you "
"have to complete to start a new process case. The email trigger creates a "
"new process case when it receives email at its own email address. There is "
"no direct relation between triggers and start events."
msgstr ""

msgid "Role"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A role is a mechanism used to assign user tasks in a process. Roles "
"correspond to swimlanes in a BPMN diagram, and are also known as a process "
"roles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Process roles are different from organizational roles. For example, there "
"might be people your organization with the role ‘Support engineer’. However,"
" each support case only has one person in the ‘Support contact’ process "
"role. A process role only lasts for the duration of a case, while "
"organizational roles are more static and relate to the job you perform at "
"the organization. See :ref:`Roles <roles>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Organization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An organization represents a collection of Effektif users - typically a "
"company - together with all their data in Effektif. The data in an "
"organization is not visible to people outside the organization. When you’re "
"logged into Effektif, you see all the data inside one particular "
"organization. If you’re a member of multiple organizations, you can switch "
"between organizations by selecting a different organization under your name "
"in the top right corner."
