msgid ""
"When you define a process in Signavio Workflow, you often include your "
"own data in the process definition, such as the list of options for a "
"form field. This works well for small lists that don’t change often or "
"that belong to the process, such as a list of document statuses in a "
"document approval process. However, fixed lists in the process definition"
" become difficult to maintain when the data changes frequently or "
"includes a large number of items, such as a list of products or "
"customers."

msgid ""
"With Signavio Workflow, you can also integrate dynamic structured data "
"from other IT systems into your workflows. The workflow system "
"communicates with a third-party system using a *connector*, which a "
"customer or a partner implements and hosts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A connector provides a web service that translates between the external "
"system and Signavio Workflow. The connector implements a defined "
"interface, which Signavio Workflow uses to access data in a format it can"
" use. Signavio Workflow and the connector communicate over *HTTP* or "
"*HTTPS*, with *JSON* as the data format. The open standards that define "
"HTTP and JSON make it possible to implement connectors in any programming"
" language."

msgid "Implementing a connector"
msgstr ""
