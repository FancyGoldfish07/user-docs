"This tutorial introduces the simplest way to get started with Signavio "
"Workflow. You can start without first defining a process by :ref:`start-"
"adhoc`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Workflows are often used for document approvals, so this tutorial uses "
"the example of approving a report, called *June report*."

msgid ""
"In the main menu, select *Cases* and then in the *Cases of* list, select "
"*Cases without a process* from the bottom of the list. This opens "
":ref:`Cases <cases-overview>` view, which you can use to create and view "
":ref:`ad hoc cases <start-adhoc>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The cases view, where you can start a new case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select *Start new case* to start creating a new ad hoc case. This opens "

msgid "Entering a case name"

msgid ""
"Now add a document: on the right, select *Upload a document* and select "
"the report to review, **June report.pdf**. On the left, in the *Add a new"
" task* text input, enter the task name **Approve report** to create a "
"task."

msgid "Adding a document to the event stream and a task to the task list"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can add as many tasks to the case as you like. Use separate tasks for"
" work that different people will do, or work that will be completed at "
"different times."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the text box above the event stream to :ref:`add "
"comments to the case <comments>`, to add information and collaborate with"
" other people."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the *Approve report* task in the list to open the task details "
"view. Under the task name, use the assignee selector to assign the task "
"to someone, who will receive a :ref:`notification <task-assigned>`. Use "
"the date selector to choose a due date, which will result in reminders if"
" the case is not complete in time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Details of a task within a case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the *Done* button to complete the task. As this is the only open "
"task in the case, this closes the case as well. You can see that the case"
" is closed by the grey case name background, and from the most event in "
"the event stream."
msgstr ""

msgid "A closed case, after its last task is complete"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use a similar case for any other kind of approval. Use event "
