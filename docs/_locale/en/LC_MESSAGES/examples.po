"This chapter describes a number of example processes. Signavio Workflow "
"includes some of these include_examples within the application, so you "

"model. These include_examples may also give you some inspiration for how "
"to use Signavio Workflow’s features in your own models."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the main menu, select `include_examples` to browse the list, and "
"expand each example to read a description. Select `Copy to your "
"organisation` to open a copy of an example in the :ref:`process-builder`,"

msgid "Process goal"
msgstr ""

msgid "Approve the submitted document, after optional revision rounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Context"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Employees need to submit expense forms for their managers to approve, but"
" if they all send them by e-mail their managers will find it difficult to"
" keep track. Employees typically submit an expense form in a spreadsheet "
"file that lists expenses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Employees also prepare proposals and reports that require management "
"sign-off before the author may distribute them. The frequently have "
"trouble keeping track of the document versions during the process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can treat expense forms as a specific example of process documents. "
"Business processes often use documents to capture a process milestone. "
"Managers often use a document approval process to verify that someone has"
" completed some other work, usually by exchanging email with the document"
" author. Use an Approve Document process when you need to keep track of a"
" large number of approvals, or when you need a record of each approval "
"(who and when)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid "Form - the uploaded document and its author."
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process centres on a *Review document* task, which results in a "
"decision to either *Approve* or *Reject* the document. Rejecting the "
"document creates an *Update document* task to update the document and "
"provide a new draft before starting again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adding a due date and reminders to the user tasks can help minimise cycle"
" times. Adding escalation to the *Review document* task helps avoid a "
"delay when the reviewer cannot complete the work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Roles"
msgstr ""

msgid "The two tasks correspond to two process roles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Reviewer* (optional) - makes the approval decision: often a manager or "
"supervisor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Author* - prepares the document. If the trigger form assigns this role, "
"then Signavio Workflow will automatically assign the *Update document* to"
" the author and send a notification."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fields"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Document* (File, mandatory) - the document to review. The author uploads"
" the first version on the trigger form, followed by a new version each "
"time Signavio Workflow creates a new *Update document* task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Author* (User, mandatory) - used to assign the role and notify the "
"author."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The document’s readers may find it useful to have access to the document "
"outside Signavio Workflow. The organisation may also require a backup. "
"You could add an integration task to the process after the decision to "
"approve the document, in order to archive or email the document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To archive the approved document, add a Google Drive or Box *Upload file*"
" task. This saves a copy of the document for people to read, but they "
"still need a notification that the approved version exists."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An email task notifies the author and other stakeholders that the "
"document has been approved. The email template can include any reviewer "
"comments and attach the document. The organisation may also find it "
"useful to broaden the document’s distribution by copying the email to a "
"distribution list."

msgstr ""

msgid "Approve an employee’s planned vacation dates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Employees need to request vacation dates, so that their managers can make"

"typically e-mail requests to a designated coordinator, who maintains a "
"spreadsheet of requests. However, this generates a lot of e-mail, and "
"fails when the coordinator goes on vacation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Vacation requests exemplify form based requests, where an employee "
"requires an approval based on information whose structure you know in "
"advance. An employee requesting vacation days for specific dates "
"illustrates perhaps the simplest example of human tasks that multiple "
"people co-ordinate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Despite this process’ simplicity, the obvious spreadsheet plus e-mail "
"approach leads to enough problems to make it worth using Signavio "
"Workflow instead. In principle, one person can easily receive vacation "

msgid ""
"Job applications drive the :ref:`Hire employee <hire-employee>` process, "

msgstr ""

msgid "Develop a business contact into a sales opportunity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sales managers often have a large number of meetings with both qualified "

"sales manager might write on their new contact’s business card, after "
"their first meeting, to indicate whether to follow up *now*, *later* or "
"*never*. Responding *now* might mean requesting another meeting, while "
"*later* could mean sending a friendly but non-committal response. "
"Although a simple to do list application might provide enough "

msgid ""
"The core activities of many companies include selling things to their "

msgstr ""

msgid "Form - provides the purchase order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this process, an incoming purchase order form essentially triggers two"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prevent an exception when the company cannot fulfil the purchase order"
" due to lack of stock, the workflow starts with a check task and a "

msgstr ""

msgid "Send a job offer letter to a successful job applicant."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Recruiting an employee requires a long elapsed time to complete - "
"typically a couple of months - and involves a number of people. Unless "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a project organisation starts a new project, the project team (or "

msgid ""
"*Junior claims adjuster* - triages insurance claims and processes the "
"straightforward ones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Investigator* - investigates high-value claims to protect against "
"fraudulent claims."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Senior claims adjuster* - processes complex claims."

msgid ""
"*Claim form* (File, mandatory) - the form provided by the customer, via "
"the trigger form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Total value* (Money, mandatory) - the total value of the claim, which "
"the junior adjuster extracts from the claim form in the *Calculate claim "
"value* task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Payout* (Money, mandatory) - the amount to pay to the customer if the "

msgid "Respond To Email (customer service)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Respond to a (potential) customer’s email enquiry by sending an email "
"reply."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Companies often have a contact email address on their web site, like "
"*info@example.com*, that routes customer email to a mailing list that "
"several employees subscribe to. These people have to coordinate so that "
"precisely one person responds to incoming mail in a timely manner. "
"Attempting to do this solely by using email tends to result in ignored "
"emails that ‘someone’ will probably reply to, or double replies when two "
"people pick up the enquiry at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Email - a customer request."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unusually, this process consists of a single user task - for responding "
"to the email - followed by an email task to send the reply."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This process minimally demonstrates the value of task assignment. The "
"process’ value comes from the automated notifications from setting the "
"user task’s candidate group, due date, reminders and escalation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A simpler version of this process only has a single user task, and relies"
" on the assignee to send the email normally."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ship Product From Warehouse (logistics)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a warehouse operation, fulfil an order by shipping physical products "
"to the customer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A product manufacturer typically runs warehouses that contain an "
"inventory of products, ready to ship to customers. In the warehouse, a "
"customer order - initially just information - results in physical "
"activity and becomes associated with physical products."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This process participates in a broader customer order process that "
"happens in the context of a warehouse. The order status that triggers "
"this process, and changes when this process completes, may orchestrate "
"this process."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Form* - an order form that lists order lines for the products to ship."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process takes a customer order and ships physical inventory from a "
"warehouse. Warehouse staff retrieve the order and perform a sequence of "
"tasks before actually shipping the parcels."
msgstr ""

msgid "A long sequence of tasks characterises this process, as follows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Retrieve customer order* - retrieve the order from the order management "
"system and make it available to warehouse staff, e.g. by printing it or "
"transferring to a work queue in a handheld device."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Pick items* - for each order line, finding the items in the warehouse "
"and adding them to a ‘basket’, possibly for multiple orders at once with "
"an efficient planned route through the warehouse."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Pack items into parcels* - efficiently pack items into standard parcels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Weigh parcels* - to capture parcel weight and dimensions, for the "
"shipping label."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Print shipping labels* - print and attached labels showing the customer "
"delivery address and other information such as weight and dimensions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Move to loading dock* - stack parcels ready for loading on the next "
"truck. Inspect packing quality - quality control to check for correctly "
"packed parcels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Check parcel count* - a ‘head-count’ to check that there no orders have "
"missing parcels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Load parcels on truck* - loading happens in a batch together with "
"parcels for other orders, and may only happen once per day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Update order status* - record process completion in the order management"
" system, which may trigger other processes such as invoicing the "
"customer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Adjust stock levels* - update the warehouse’s inventory management "
"system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Send delivery instructions* - provide the transport company with the "
"information they require to deliver the shipment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Warehouse staff will take advantage of this process’ flexibility in "
"practice. Staff may perform the tasks sequentially in practice, even "
"though they could perform them in parallel. Staff may also batch multiple"
" orders together at various steps, due to waiting times such as waiting "
"for the next truck to arrive at the warehouse."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Warehouse operator* - responsible for operations in the warehouse, "
"moving goods from stock to trucks for shipment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Order form* (File, required) - lists order lines of products to ship "
"from the warehouse."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Order reference* (Text, required) - extracted from the order form, "
"uniquely identifies the order in Signavio Workflow."
msgstr ""

msgid "To extend or enhance this process, you could:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"trigger the process from an external order management system, as a result"
" of an order status change"
msgstr ""

msgid "automate the *Retrieve customer order* and *Print shipping labels* tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"add information to *The Pick stock items* task, e.g. by scanning bar "
"codes to record the picked items’ serial numbers"
msgstr ""

msgid "make the *Inspect packing quality* task optional or randomised.."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this process, transport runs on a fixed schedule: warehouse staff load"
" parcels for multiple orders onto trucks. A different shipping process "
"could arrange individual transport (e.g. by courier) for each order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sign Contract (management)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sign a document and archive the signed copy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Managers frequently have to sign contracts, and approve other documents. "
"This may take some time, if a backlog has built up, in which case the "
"requester needs some visibility."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Manual* - the requester uploads a document for a manager to sign."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The core process consists of tasks for the signer to review the document "
"and then sign it. Signavio Workflow then archives the signed document and"
" notifies the requester."
msgstr ""

msgid "This process includes three additional scenarios:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The signer requests that someone else sign the document, and reassigns "
"the *Signer* role."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The signer requests a change to the document, and the requester gets a "
"new task to update the document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The signer declines to sign the document, and the requester receives a "
"notification."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Requester* - submits the document and makes any required corrections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Signer* - responsible for deciding whether to sign the document, and "
"adding the signature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Original document* (File, mandatory) - the document that requires a "
"signature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Change request* (Text, multiple values) - a correction or addition that "
"the signer requests before signing."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Signed document* (File, mandatory)."
msgstr ""
