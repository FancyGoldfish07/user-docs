"This chapter describes a number of example processes. Signavio Workflow "
"Accelerator includes some of these examples within the application, so "
"you don’t have to start from scratch when you develop your first process "
"model. These examples may also give you some inspiration for how to use "
"Workflow Accelerator’s features in your own models."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the main menu, select `Examples` to browse the list, and expand each "
"example to read a description. Select `Copy to your organisation` to open"
" a copy of an example in the :ref:`process builder <processes>`, so you "
"can explore the process model, modify it and publish it. If you don’t "
"want to use an example you have copied, you can :ref:`delete it <copy-"

msgid "Approve Document (management)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Process goal"
msgstr ""

msgid "Approve the submitted document, after optional revision rounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Context"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Employees need to submit expense forms for their managers to approve, but"
" if they all send them by e-mail their managers will find it difficult to"
" keep track. Employees typically submit an expense form in a spreadsheet "
"file that lists expenses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Employees also prepare proposals and reports that require management "
"sign-off before the author may distribute them. The frequently have "
"trouble keeping track of the document versions during the process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can treat expense forms as a specific example of process documents. "
"Business processes often use documents to capture a process milestone. "
"Managers often use a document approval process to verify that someone has"
" completed some other work, usually by exchanging email with the document"
" author. Use an Approve Document process when you need to keep track of a"
" large number of approvals, or when you need a record of each approval "
"(who and when)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid "Form - the uploaded document and its author."
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process centres on a *Review document* task, which results in a "
"decision to either *Approve* or *Reject* the document. Rejecting the "
"document creates an *Update document* task to update the document and "
"provide a new draft before starting again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adding a due date and reminders to the user tasks can help minimise cycle"
" times. Adding escalation to the *Review document* task helps avoid a "
"delay when the reviewer cannot complete the work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Roles"
msgstr ""

msgid "The two tasks correspond to two process roles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Reviewer* (optional) - makes the approval decision: often a manager or "
"supervisor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Author* - prepares the document. If the trigger form assigns this role, "
"then Signavio Workflow Accelerator will automatically assign the *Update "
"document* to the author and send a notification."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fields"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Document* (File, mandatory) - the document to review. The author uploads"
" the first version on the trigger form, followed by a new version each "
"time Workflow Accelerator creates a new *Update document* task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Author* (User, mandatory) - used to assign the role and notify the "
"author."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The document’s readers may find it useful to have access to the document "
"outside Workflow Accelerator. The organisation may also require a backup."
" You could add an integration task to the process after the decision to "
"approve the document, in order to archive or email the document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To archive the approved document, add a Google Drive or Box *Upload file*"
" task. This saves a copy of the document for people to read, but they "
"still need a notification that the approved version exists."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An email task notifies the author and other stakeholders that the "
"document has been approved. The email template can include any reviewer "
"comments and attach the document. The organisation may also find it "
"useful to broaden the document’s distribution by copying the email to a "
"distribution list."

msgid "Review, approve and archive the minutes of a meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Formal meetings produce minutes that the meeting chair must approve "
"before distribution. Delays in this approval process can reduce the value"

msgstr ""

msgid "Approve an employee’s planned vacation dates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Employees need to request vacation dates, so that their managers can make"
" sure that they don’t all go on vacation at the same time. Employees "
"typically e-mail requests to a designated coordinator, who maintains a "
"spreadsheet of requests. However, this generates a lot of e-mail, and "
"fails when the coordinator goes on vacation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Vacation requests exemplify form based requests, where an employee "
"requires an approval based on information whose structure you know in "
"advance. An employee requesting vacation days for specific dates "
"illustrates perhaps the simplest example of human tasks that multiple "
"people co-ordinate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Despite this process’ simplicity, the obvious spreadsheet plus e-mail "
"approach leads to enough problems to make it worth using Workflow "
"Accelerator instead. In principle, one person can easily receive vacation"
" requests by e-mail and maintain a spreadsheet, but this fails when this "
"person goes on vacation. This irony illustrates the need for notify a "
"group about new unassigned tasks, so that several people can approve "
"vacation requests between themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid "Form - the employee and the requested dates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process consists of a user task for a decision. Tasks to continue the"
" process of going on vacation (or not) follow the decision."

"Adding a due date and reminders to the user task can help reduce cycle "
"times."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Manager* - approves the request."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Employee* (User, mandatory) - the employee making the request. This, "
"plus the other fields, should give the manager enough information to make"

msgstr ""

msgid "*Start date* (Date) - vacation start date."

msgid "*End date* (Date) - vacation end date."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You might extend the process with an additional task for the employee to "
"provide additional information, or change the initial request, if the "
"manager rejected the request. This would avoid the need for more cases "

msgid "Fill a vacant position within the organisation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Job applications drive the :ref:`Hire employee <hire-employee>` process, "

msgid "Follow-up Contact (sales)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Develop a business contact into a sales opportunity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sales managers often have a large number of meetings with both qualified "
"prospects and ad hoc contacts. They may use triage to prioritise follow-"

"sales manager might write on their new contact’s business card, after "

"*never*. Responding *now* might mean requesting another meeting, while "
"*later* could mean sending a friendly but non-committal response. "
"Although a simple to do list application might provide enough "

"The core activities of many companies include selling things to their "

msgstr ""

msgid "Sign a document and archive the signed copy."
