"A case is a essentially a small collaboration space for a particular goal. "
"For example, 'Hire HR manager' or 'Send quote to customer X'. Cases are "
"typically bigger then a simple task for a single person and smaller then a "
"project. A case is used to break down the goal into concrete action items "
"(or tasks) and to collaborate with others. The case is the central place "
"where all relevant context information about the topic is shared and "
"discussed."

"When tasks have a form, the form is displayed in the same position and it "

" or make a comment, you can still do that and you don't need to reopen the "
"task for that. Reopening a task can be better then creating a new task "
