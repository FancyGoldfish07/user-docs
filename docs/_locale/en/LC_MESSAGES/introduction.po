#: ../../introduction.rst:15
msgid ""
"A process is a template for repetitive work. Processes are typically created"
" by people who manage work and specify which tasks and actions have to be "
"performed to reach a certain goal. For example: for every hire case, the "
"tasks \"Conduct interview\", \"Prepare contract\" and \"Create email "
"account\" have to be completed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:20
msgid ""
"After a process is published, many individual cases can be started. Effektif"
" keeps track of which tasks and actions have to be performed for each case. "
"Cases bring people together with relevant information that provides context "
"for completing the tasks. Cases are also collaboration spaces where people "
"can discuss and create new tasks for individual cases on the fly."
