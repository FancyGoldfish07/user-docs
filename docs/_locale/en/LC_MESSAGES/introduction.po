msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process - strictly a process *model* - defines a template for "
"repetitive work. The people who manage work typically create processes "
"and specify the tasks and actions that you must complete to reach a "
"certain goal. For example: for every `Hire employee "
"<https://www.signavio.com/workflow-examples/hire-employee/>`_ case, "
"someone must complete the *Plan interview*, *Interview candidate* and "
"*Send job offer* tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you publish a process, you can start many individual cases. "
"Workflow Accelerator keeps track of which tasks and actions you have to "
"perform for each case. Cases bring people together with relevant "
"information that provides context for completing the tasks. You can also "
"use cases as collaboration spaces for people to discuss and create new "
"tasks for individual cases on the fly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Acknowledgements"

msgid ""
"Signavio uses open source software. We thank everyone involved in the "
"open source community. Please download the :download:`list of open source"
" components that Workflow Accelerator uses <download/Open-Source-"
"Components-Signavio-Workflow.pdf>`  (PDF)."
