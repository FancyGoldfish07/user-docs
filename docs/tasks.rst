Tasks
=====

A task represents work that someone is expected to complete.
:ref:`Cases <cases>` typically include multiple tasks,
which are usually part of the process definition.
You can also add ad-hoc tasks to a case.

In Effektif, a task may be assigned to a specific user, and have a due date and subtasks.

Viewing your tasks in the Inbox
-------------------------------

The *Inbox* shows an overview of tasks that are assigned to you:
a list of tasks for you to work on.
To open the Inbox, select *Tasks* from the main menu
and select the *Inbox* tab.

   The tasks Inbox

Each task shows the assignee, 
which is you for everything in the inbox,
and a link to the task itself.

The left-hand side of the inbox is split into sections for tasks that have due dates,
so you can prioritise your work.
Tasks that are assigned to you, but donâ€™t have a due date, 
are listed on the right.


Viewing all tasks
-----------------

The *All tasks* view shows tasks for all assignees.

   The list of all tasks


Tasks with due dates have a clock indicator to the right of the task name.
This indicator is shown in red for tasks that are now due.

You can use the controls on the right to filter the tasks list,
which is useful when there is lots of work going on.


Task filters
------------

The *All tasks* view includes several kinds of task filters,
that you can use to manage a long list of tasks.

- *Involvement filter* - shows tasks according to how they relate to you,
  such as tasks you started.
- *Process* filter - shows tasks for a specific process.
- *Due date* filter - shows tasks according to when they are due,
  such as tasks that are overdue.
- *Completed* filter - shows tasks that are complete,
  which are normally hidden.
