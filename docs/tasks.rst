Tasks
=====

A task represents work that someone will presumably complete.
:ref:`cases` typically include multiple tasks, usually those that the process defines.
You can also add ad-hoc tasks to a case.

In Signavio Workflow Accelerator, you can assign a task to a specific user, set a due date and add subtasks.
