License types
=============

To log in to Signavio Workflow, your user account have a user license that has not expired.
You can choose between several license types:

* Enterprise Cloud Free Trial
* Enterprise Cloud
* Professional Cloud
* Developer Cloud
* Academic Cloud

The *Feature Overview* section on the `Signavio Workflow product page <http://www.signavio.com/products/workflow/>`_ shows the main differences between these versions.
These differences affect:

* the license expiry period - typically one or twelve months
* which software features you can use
* the amount of user file storage
* the support level.

The :ref:`billing` page in the application shows details of the current license type.


Enterprise Cloud Free Trial
---------------------------

The free trial license lets you try the full version of the software for a limited period without purchasing a license.
To create a trial license, use the `registration <https://workflow.signavio.com/registration>`_ page.
When the trial expires, Signavio Workflow will send you an email inviting you to purchase licenses.


Enterprise Cloud
----------------

A *Enterprise Cloud* license gives you full access to all features with minimum limitations.
To purchase *Enterprise Cloud* licenses, contact `sales@signavio.com <mailto:sales@signavio.com?subject=Signavio%20Workflow%20Enterprise%20Cloud>`_.


Professional Cloud
------------------

A *Professional Cloud* license gives you access to core features for a lower license cost than *Enterprise Cloud*.
To purchase *Professional Cloud* licenses, contact `sales@signavio.com <mailto:sales@signavio.com?subject=Signavio%20Workflow%20Professional%20Cloud>`_.


Developer Cloud
---------------

A free *Developer Cloud* license allows developers to create and test process models without having to purchase a license.
You can only use this license in an organisation with a single user, which means that multiple people cannot use it for collaborative process execution.

Academic Cloud
--------------

A free *Academic Cloud* license allows university students to use Signavio Workflow to learn about workflow management.
You may only use this license if you have a valid university email address.
You may only use this license for educational purposes and not for administrative processes in an educational institution.
To register for an academic license, use the *academic version* link at the bottom of the `purchasing <https://workflow.signavio.com/buy>`_ page.
