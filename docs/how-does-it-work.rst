How it works

A process is a template for repetitive work.
Processes are typically created by people who manage work
and specify which tasks and actions have to be performed to reach a certain goal.
For example: for every hire case, the tasks ‘Conduct interview’, ‘Prepare contract’ and ‘Create email account’ have to be completed.

After a process is published, many individual cases can be started.
Effektif keeps track of which tasks and actions have to be performed for each case.
Cases bring people together with relevant information that provides context for completing the tasks.
Cases are also collaboration spaces where people can discuss and create new tasks for individual cases on the fly.
