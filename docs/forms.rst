Forms
=====

In Effektif, you can use forms to enter information when you run a process.
There are two places where you can use a form: form triggers and user tasks.

Form triggers
-------------

You use a :ref:`form trigger <form-trigger>` 
to set the values of :ref:`process variables <variables>`
when you start a new case for a process.

   Starting a new case with a form trigger

To add a form trigger to a process,
use the process builder’s :ref:`Triggers <triggers>` page to 
select `When a form is submitted`.


User task forms
---------------

You use a :ref:`user task <user-task>` form 
to view and edit the values of :ref:`process variables <variables>`.

   Viewing and editing values on a user task form

To add a user task form to a process,
use the process builder’s :ref:`Actions <actions>` page to add a user task, 
and on the user task’s configuration panel, select the `Form` tab.
