Cases
=====

A case is a essentially a small collaboration space for a particular goal.
For example, 'Hire HR manager' or 'Send quote to customer X'.
Cases are typically bigger then a simple task for a single person and smaller then a project.
A case is used to break down the goal into concrete action items (or tasks) and to collaborate with others.
The case is the central place where all relevant context information about the topic is shared and discussed.

Creating a case
---------------

To create a new case, navigate to `Cases`;
on the `Cases of` menu, select `Cases without a process`, then click 'Start new case'.

.. figure:: /_static/images/cases/create/create-case.png

   Start a new task

Then the case header appears.

.. figure:: /_static/images/cases/create/name-case.png

   Enter case title

Next, type the case title and hit Enter. The new case is now created.

   New case

Creating case tasks
-------------------

In a case, you can break down tasks like this.
If you don't have tasks, the tasks section might have to opened like shown in this scenario:

.. figure:: /_static/images/tasks/create/create-task.png

   Type the title of the new task and hit Enter

.. figure:: /_static/images/tasks/create/view-task.png

When a process is started, a :ref:`case <cases>` is created and all elements not having incoming transitions will be started.
So if you only use the :ref:`simple action list <action-list>` to create a list of user tasks, all those tasks in the list will be started immediate when the process starts.

Completing a task
-----------------

For tasks, there is a highlighted `Done` button to complete the task.

When tasks have a form, the form is displayed in the same position and it has the button(s) to complete the task at the bottom of the form.
Normally that will just be the `Done`-button, but in case of decisions, it can be multiple buttons.
Each of those buttons will register the decision and complete the task in one go.

Reopening a task
----------------

When you see the `Reopen` button in a task, it means the task is completed.
Reopening is good when you closed a task by accident or when you realize more needs to be done for this task.
If you just forgot to attach a document or make a comment, you can still do that and you don't need to reopen the task for that.
Reopening a task can be better then creating a new task because it has all the context in it.
