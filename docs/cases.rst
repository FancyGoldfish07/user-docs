Cases
=====

A case is a essentially a small collaboration space for a particular goal.
For example, ‘Hire employee’ or ‘Sign contract’.
Cases are typically bigger then a simple task for a single person and smaller then a project.

A case is used to break down the goal into concrete action items (or tasks) and to collaborate with others.
The case is the central place where all relevant context information about the topic is shared and discussed.

Viewing cases
-------------

The *Cases* view shows an overview of cases for a single process.
To open the Cases view, select *Cases* from the main menu.

   The Cases view - cases of the ‘Hire employee’ process

The table shows cases for the *Hire employee* process.
You can use the menu above the table to select a different process,
ad hoc cases that don’t have a process,
or cases of a deleted process.
Each case in the table show the case name,
grey and green task status bars,
and additional columns that show the values of workflow :ref:`variables <variables>`.

The grey and green status bars show information about completed and open tasks
when you hover the mouse cursor over them.

To the right of these status bars are workflow data columns,
which you can customize.


Customizing case view table columns
-----------------------------------

The *Cases* view’s table includes columns for workflow :ref:`variables <variables>`,
which are usually form fields on a trigger form or in a user task.
You can select which fields are shown as table columns in the Cases view,
so you can have a clear overview of the process’ cases.

To customize the table columns,
open the Cases view and click the top-right *Configure columns* button.

   Configuring table columns

Use the drag icon on the far left of the list of columns to change the column order,
and click the delete icon on the far right to remove a column.
You can also use the text box to edit the column’s heading.

Below the list of columns, is a menu for selecting additional column to add to the table.

   Adding a column to the table

The menu lists all of the workflow variables that are not currently included in the table.
In this example, the *Interviewer* variable is a *User*,
which means that additional fields are available for the user’s email address, 
first name, ID and last name.


Creating a case

To create a new case, navigate to *Cases*;
on the *Cases of* menu, select *Cases without a process*, then click *Start new case*.
