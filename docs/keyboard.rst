Keyboard shortcuts
==================

In some parts of the software, you can use the keyboard as well as the mouse for specific operations.

Process builder
---------------

arrow keys
   Move the selected diagram element
Delete
   Delete the selected diagram element

.. note:

   In the process builder, if you select an action with no name, then the keyboard shortcuts do not work because the action name field in the configuration panel gets keyboard focus.
   Click the action a second time to return focus to the diagram, so the shortcuts work.

Case details view
-----------------

R
   Refresh case
