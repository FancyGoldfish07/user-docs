A process is a template for repetitive work.
Processes are typically created by managers and specify which tasks and actions have to be performed to reach a certain goal.
For example: For every hire tasks 'Interview', 'Contract' and 'Email account' have to be completed.

After a process is published, many individual cases can be started.
Effektif keeps track of which tasks and actions have to be performed for each case.
Cases bring together people and all relevant context information to complete the tasks.
Cases are collaboration spaces.
People can discuss and create new tasks for individual cases on the fly.
