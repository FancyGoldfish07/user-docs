Introduction
============

Effektif is a web-based workflow modelling and execution platform.
Although its heritage includes classical Business Process Management Systems (BPMS),
Effektif dramatically simplifies workflow automation.

How it works
------------

A process is a template for repetitive work.
Processes are typically created by people who manage work
and specify which tasks and actions have to be performed to reach a certain goal.
For example: for every hire case, the tasks "Conduct interview", "Prepare contract" and "Create email account" have to be completed.

After a process is published, many individual cases can be started.
Effektif keeps track of which tasks and actions have to be performed for each case.
Cases bring people together with relevant information that provides context for completing the tasks.
Cases are also collaboration spaces where people can discuss and create new tasks for individual cases on the fly.

When to use Effektif
--------------------

Effektif is ideal for describing and collaborating on routine work. Use Effektif for:

- coordinating tasks and handovers
- approvals
- routing documents
- fully-fledged business processes.

Benefits
--------

You’ll get:

- control where it’s needed
- flexibility where it’s possible
- fewer delays (with automatic triggers, actions and timers)
- no more miscommunications during handovers
- traceability - data on who did what
- clarity - visibility of who has to do what
- agility - because Effektif process models are easier to change than software.
