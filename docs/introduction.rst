Introduction
============

`Signavio Workflow Accelerator <http://www.signavio.com/products/workflow/>`_ is a web-based workflow modelling and execution platform.
Although its heritage includes classical Business Process Management Systems (BPMS),
Workflow Accelerator dramatically simplifies workflow automation.

How it works
------------

A process - strictly a process *model* - defines a template for repetitive work.
The people who manage work typically create processes and specify the tasks and actions that you must complete to reach a certain goal.
For example: for every `Hire employee <https://www.signavio.com/workflow-examples/hire-employee/>`_ case, someone must complete the *Plan interview*, *Interview candidate* and *Send job offer* tasks.

After you publish a process, you can start many individual cases.
Workflow Accelerator keeps track of which tasks and actions you have to perform for each case.
Cases bring people together with relevant information that provides context for completing the tasks.
You can also use cases as collaboration spaces for people to discuss and create new tasks for individual cases on the fly.

When to use Workflow Accelerator
--------------------------------

You will find Workflow Accelerator useful for describing and collaborating on routine work.
Use Workflow Accelerator for:

- coordinating tasks and handovers

- fully-fledged business processes.
