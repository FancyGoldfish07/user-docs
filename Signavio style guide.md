# Signavio technical writing style guide

Signavio technical writers should use this style guide to improve the consistency and quality of all kinds of documentation for external use.
Documentation includes user guides, installation instructions, blog posts, and white papers.

## Relationship to other style guides

In the first instance, follow the [Apple Style Guide](http://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/) ([PDF version](https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf)).
This style-guide defines Signavio-specific additions and exceptions to the _Apple Style Guide_.
Note that the _Apple Style Guide_ defers to _The Chicago Manual of Style_, which Signavio employees cannot generally access.
An update to this guide could resolve this by specifying a different base style guide.

Although these style guides use US English, we write for an international audience.

## Signavio software and product names

Use the product names as written:

* **Collaboration Portal**
* **Signavio Business Transformation Platform**
* **Signavio Decision Manager**
* **Signavio Explorer**
* **Signavio Process Editor**
* **Signavio Process Intelligence**
* **Signavio Workflow**

Omit **the** before names: ‘Signavio Explorer’, not ‘the Signavio Explorer’.

For names longer than two words, you may omit **Signavio** after the first use.


## Capitalization

**Headings** Use sentence-case.

## Formatting

**User input** Use bold text, e.g. ‘In the task name field, enter **Approve report**.’

**User-interface text** Italicize, e.g. ‘On the _New_ menu, select _Folder_.’

## Word list

**Dictionary** Refers to the [Dictionary](https://editor.signavio.com/userguide/en/dictionary/) feature in **Process Editor** and **Decision Manager**; for a list of defined terms, use _Glossary_.

**Email** Omit hyphen.

**Modeling** US English spelling with one ‘l’.

**Signavio** Refers to the company; for software, use the product name.
