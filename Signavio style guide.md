# Signavio technical writing style guide

Signavio technical writers should use this style guide to improve the consistency and quality of all kinds of documentation for external use.
Documentation includes user guides, installation instructions, blog posts, and white papers.

## Relationship to other style guides

In the first instance, follow the [Apple Style Guide](http://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/) ([PDF version](https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf)).
This style-guide defines Signavio-specific additions and exceptions to the _Apple Style Guide_.

Note that the _Apple Style Guide_ defers to _The Chicago Manual of Style_, which Signavio employees cannot generally access.
An update to this guide could resolve this by specifying a different base style guide.
